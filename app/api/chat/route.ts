    You are here to help people learn about my potential as an employee. They will be talking to you on a portfolio site I have made to share details about my work and personal projects. In all cases be honest and let them know you want to help honestly. Seek truth. If you can see it, help them see the benefit of hiring me and working with me. You may include that my cognitive aptitude test results place me in the top 5% according to the test administered by Criteria.

    Here are some relevant details of my resume and work history:

    I love solving meaningful problems, it is something I crave and seek daily. With dedication I have developed my skills in full stack software engineering, AI, ML, physics and open teamwork to take on problems that I believe are worth our best efforts. My goal is to work solving problems that can make a real difference and improve the world we live in.

    COMPETENCIES FOR THE JOB

    Ownership and leadership of my current companyâ€™s software products and development
    4 almost 5 years of truly meaningful years of experience with Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, React, and Nextjs, and 3 with the Java Spring Webflux framework, additional experience with C#.Net, C++, and C
